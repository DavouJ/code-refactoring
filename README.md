# code-refactoring

## Improving the Horiseon website by adapting its elements

I WANT:
- Semantic HTML elements to be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements to contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes to fall in sequential order
- Title elements to contain a concise, descriptive title

SO THAT the codebase follows accessibility standards
SO THAT the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
