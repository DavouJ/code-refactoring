# code-refactoring

## Improving the Horiseon website by adapting its elements

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

I WANT:
- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

SO THAT the codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines
