## Improving the Horiseon website by adapting its elements

I WANT:
- Semantic HTML elements to be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements to contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes to fall in sequential order
- Title elements to contain a concise, descriptive title

SO THAT 
- The codebase follows accessibility standards
- The Horiseon site is optimized for search engines
